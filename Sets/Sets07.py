# Exercise 7: Set Difference Update
# Given two Python sets, write a program to update the first set with only the items
# that are unique to it (i.e., not present in the second set).
#
# Given:
#
# set1 = {10, 20, 30}
# set2 = {20, 40, 50}
# Expected output:
#
# set1 {10, 30}

set1 = {10, 20, 30}
set2 = {20, 40, 50}

set1.difference_update(set2)
print(set1)
