# Exercise 11: Print all prime numbers within a range
# Note: A Prime Number is a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11)
#
# A Prime Number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers.
#
# Examples:
#
# 6 is not a prime number because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
# 37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply to make it.
# Given:
#
# # range
# start = 25
# end = 50
# Expected output:
#
# Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
# 29
# 31
# 37
# 41
# 43
# 47

prime_num = []
start = int(input("enter the start number"))
end = int(input("enter the end of prime:"))
for i in range(start, end):
    for j in range(2, i):
        if i % j == 0:
            break
    else:
        prime_num.append(i)
for i in prime_num:
    print(i)
