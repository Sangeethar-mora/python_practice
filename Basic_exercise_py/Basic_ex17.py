# Exercise 17: Generate Fibonacci series up to 15 terms
# Have you ever wondered about the Fibonacci Sequence? Itâ€™s a series of numbers in which the next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1.
#
# For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series is 13 + 21 = 34.
#
# Expected output:
#
# Fibonacci sequence:
# 0  1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55  89  144  233  377
